# jsql

Experimental DSL for SQL generation for next version of clojure.ja

## Usage

Generate SQL and parameters that can be use in **with-query-results** style expression:
```clojure
(select * :person)
;;=> ["SELECT * FROM person" nil]
(select [:id :name] :person
  (where {:email "user@domain.com"}))
;;=> ["SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE email = ?" "user@domain.com"]
(select [{:p.id :userid} :p.name :a.city] {:person :p}
  (join {:address :a} {:p.id :a.personid}
  (where {:p.email "user@domain.com"}))
;;=> ["SELECT userid, p.name FROM person p JOIN address a ON p.id = a.personid WHERE p.email = ?" "user@domain.com"]
(update :person {:status "active"})
;;=> ["UPDATE person SET status = ?" "active"]
(update :person {:status "suspended"}
  (where {:country "NG"}))
;;=> ["UPDATE person SET status = ? WHERE country = ?" "suspended" "NG"]
```
**select** expects a *column-spec*, a *table-spec*, optional *join-clauses* (as strings), an optional *where-clause* (sequence of SQL conditions as a string followed by parameters). It returns a vector whose first element is a string containing a SQL SELECT statement and whose remaining elements are the values to be substituted for parameters (**?**) in that string.

A *column-spec* may be \*, a single *column* or a sequence of *columns*. A *column* may be a string or keyword, or a map (of a single key to a single value, that specifies a column alias).

A *table-spec* may be a string or a keyword, or a map (of a single key to a single value, that specifies a table alias).

A *join-clause* is just a string containing a SQL JOIN clause. It can be generated by the **join** function.

A *where-clause* is a sequence whose first element is a string containing SQL conditions and whose remaining elements are the values to be substituted for parameters (**?**) in that string. It can be generated by the **where** function.

**delete** expects a *table-spec* and a *where-clause* (which is not optional). It returns a vector whose first element is a string containing a SQL DELETE statement and whose remaining elements are the values to be substituted for parameters (**?**) in that string.

**insert** has yet to be designed.

**join** expects a *table-spec* and a *join-map* which is used to generate the ON clause. It returns a string containing a SQL JOIN/ON clause.

A *join-map* is a map whose keys and values represent columns in the two tables being joined.

**where** expects a *value-map* which is used to generate a string that contains the conditional part of a WHERE clause and the values to be substituted for parameters (**?**) within that string. It returns a sequence whose first element is the string and whose remaining elements are the parameter values.

**update** expects a *table-spec*, an *update-map* and an optional *where-clause*. It returns a vector whose first element is a string containing a SQL UPDATE statement and whose remaining elements are the values to be substituted for parameters (**?**) in that string.

An *update-map* is a map whose keys represent columns to be set to the corresponding values.

All functions that generate SQL may have an optional **:entity** keyword argument (after the specified arguments) which specifies an identifier naming convention, e.g., **(partial jdbc/as-quoted-str \\`)** which would cause SQL entities to be quoted with **\`** (**:id** would become **\`id\`**).

The **naming** macro can be used to apply an identifier naming convention to a DSL expression. It expects a function representing the naming convention and a DSL expression. It post-walks the DSL expression and inserts the **:entity** keyword argument and naming convention at the end of each expression. *This is likely to be renamed when I can think of a better name!*

The remaining parts of the DSL are the high level parts that will execute SQL and process results. Current thinking is along these lines:
```clojure
(query db sql-params :result-set rs-fn :row row-fn)
;;=> runs a SELECT SQL statement
;;   applies row-fn to each row returned (default: identity)
;;   applies rs-fn to the whole result set (default: doall)

(execute! db sql-params)
;;=> runs a non-SELECT SQL statement and returns the update counts, if appropiate

;; I'm still thinking about how inserts should work...
(insert! db :table value-maps)
(insert! db :table col-seq value-seqs)

(update! db :table update-map where-clause)
;;=> (execute! db (update :table update-map where-clause))

(delete! db :table where-clause)
;;=> (execute! db (delete :table where-clause)
```
